NAME
    Env::Array - perl module that imports environment variables as
    arrays

SYNOPSIS
      use Env::Array qw(PATH :);

DESCRIPTION
    The Perl module `Env::Array' allows environment variables to be
    treated as array variables, much the way that the module `Env'
    them to be treated as scalar variables.

    The Env::Array::import() function requires pairs of environment
    variable names and delimiter strings to be presented in the
    `use' statement. Unlike `Env', there is no default behavior when
    no arguments are given to `use' (except to print an error
    message and die).

    After an environment variable is tied, just use it like an
    ordinary array. Bear in mind, however, that each access to the
    variable requires splitting the string anew.

    Requires Perl 5.005 or later for proper operation due to the use
    of tied arrays.
